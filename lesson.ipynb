    "- **Definition**: Binary Logistic regression is a statistical method used to predict the likelihood of a binary outcome (yes/no, 1/0) based on input factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Applications**: Here, we use a binary classification approach, with the target variable coded as 0 to represent a lower chance of a heart attack and 1 to signify a higher chance of a heart attack. This application allows us to:\n",
